    <h1>Two Dimensional Sum Solution (Polya's 4-Step Approach)</h1>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Write a function <code>twoDimensionalSum</code> that takes in a 2D array of numbers and returns the total sum of all the numbers.</p>

    <h2>Polya's Four Steps to Problem Solving:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3>
    <p>We are given a 2D array (an array of arrays) containing numbers. The goal is to calculate and return the total sum of all the numbers in the array.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Devise a Plan</h3>
    <p>We can solve this problem by iterating through the 2D array. For each subarray, we will sum its elements, and keep a running total of the sum. At the end, we will return the total sum.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Initialize a variable to store the total sum, starting at 0.</li>
        <li>Use a nested loop: the outer loop will iterate over each subarray, and the inner loop will iterate over the numbers in each subarray.</li>
        <li>For each number, add it to the total sum.</li>
        <li>Return the total sum after iterating through the entire 2D array.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Carry Out the Plan (Code)</h3>
    <pre><code>
// Main function to calculate the sum of all numbers in a 2D array
function twoDimensionalSum(arr) {
    let totalSum = 0;  // Step 1: Initialize the total sum to 0

    // Step 2: Iterate through each subarray in the 2D array
    for (let subarray of arr) {
        // Step 3: Sum each number in the subarray and add it to the total sum
        for (let num of subarray) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
    }

    return totalSum;  // Step 4: Return the total sum
}

// Test cases
console.log(twoDimensionalSum([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]));
// Expected output: 21

console.log(twoDimensionalSum([[10, 20, 30], [5, 5], [2]]));
// Expected output: 72
</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 4: Review the Solution</h3>
    <p>We tested the function with different inputs and verified that it produces the correct sum of all the numbers in the 2D array. The nested loop ensures that all elements are considered, and the running total is accurate.</p>

    <h2>Test Cases:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>twoDimensionalSum([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])</code> returns <strong>21</strong>.</li>
        <li><code>twoDimensionalSum([[10, 20, 30], [5, 5], [2]])</code> returns <strong>72</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>By following Polya's 4-step method, we successfully broke down the problem, developed a plan, and implemented a solution to calculate the total sum of all numbers in a 2D array. The function works for various types of 2D arrays and provides the correct sum.</p>
