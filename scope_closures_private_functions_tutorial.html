        <h1>Scope, Closures, and Private Functions in JavaScript</h1>
        <p>An overview of key concepts for new JavaScript developers.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Scope</h2>
        <p>Scope in JavaScript is like visibility in a house. Different rooms (functions or blocks) have their own visibility, 
        and what you can access depends on which room you're in.</p>
        <p>There are three main types of scope: global, local (function), and block scope.</p>

        <h3>Global Scope</h3>
        <p>Global scope is like the living room in a house. Anyone inside the house can see what's in the living room. 
        Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.</p>
        <pre><code>
let name = 'Alice'; // Global scope

function greet() {
    console.log('Hello ' + name); // Can access the global 'name'
}
greet(); // Outputs: 'Hello Alice'
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Function Scope</h3>
        <p>Function scope is like a bedroom—only the people inside the room can see what's inside. Variables declared inside a function 
        are only accessible within that function.</p>
        <pre><code>
function sayHello() {
    let message = 'Hello World'; // Local to the function
    console.log(message);
}

sayHello(); // Outputs: 'Hello World'
console.log(message); // Error: message is not defined
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Block Scope</h3>
        <p>Block scope is like a closet inside a room—what's inside is only accessible while you're in the closet. Variables declared with 
        <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> inside a block (<code>{ }</code>) are block-scoped.</p>
        <pre><code>
if (true) {
    let blockScoped = 'Only in this block';
    console.log(blockScoped); // Outputs: 'Only in this block'
}

console.log(blockScoped); // Error: blockScoped is not defined
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Closures</h2>
        <p>Closures are like saving a memory from a room after you leave it. If you take a photo (closure) inside a room (function), 
        you can carry that photo with you and always remember what was inside, even after you’ve left the room (the function has finished).</p>

        <h3>Closure Example</h3>
        <pre><code>
function outer() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Can access the outer function's variable
    }

    return inner;
}

const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Outputs: 'I am outside!'
        </code></pre>
        <p>Even though <code>outer()</code> has finished executing, the inner function <code>inner()</code> still has access to the <code>outerVariable</code> 
        because of the closure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Private Functions with Closures</h2>
        <p>Private functions are like secrets you keep in your room. Only you know them, and they can’t be accessed from outside.</p>
        <p>Using closures, we can create private functions in JavaScript. These functions are only accessible within the scope where they were created.</p>

        <h3>Private Function Example</h3>
        <pre><code>
function counter() {
    let count = 0;

    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count--;
            console.log(count);
        }
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment(); // 1
myCounter.increment(); // 2
myCounter.decrement(); // 1
console.log(myCounter.count); // undefined (private variable)
        </code></pre>
        <p>Here, the variable <code>count</code> is private and can only be accessed or modified through the <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> functions.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Practical Usage and Real-World Examples</h2>
        <h3>Closures in Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>In real-world applications, closures are often used in event listeners to keep track of the state:</p>
        <pre><code>
function setupButton() {
    let clicks = 0;

    document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
        clicks++;
        console.log(`Button clicked ${clicks} times`);
    });
}

setupButton();
        </code></pre>
        <p>Even though the <code>setupButton</code> function finishes, the event listener still remembers and updates the <code>clicks</code> variable because of the closure.</p>

        <h3>Private Functions in Modules</h3>
        <p>Private functions are commonly used in modules to hide internal logic and only expose necessary functionality:</p>
        <pre><code>
// Module pattern with private functions
const bankAccount = (function() {
    let balance = 1000;

    function privateLogTransaction(amount) {
        console.log(`Transaction: ${amount}`);
    }

    return {
        deposit: function(amount) {
            balance += amount;
            privateLogTransaction(amount);
            console.log(`New balance: ${balance}`);
        },
        withdraw: function(amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            privateLogTransaction(-amount);
            console.log(`New balance: ${balance}`);
        }
    };
})();

bankAccount.deposit(500); // New balance: 1500
bankAccount.withdraw(200); // New balance: 1300
        </code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the function <code>privateLogTransaction</code> is a private function that can’t be accessed directly from outside the module, 
        keeping the transaction log hidden.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scope determines what variables and functions are accessible in different parts of your code.</li>
            <li>Closures allow a function to "remember" variables from its surrounding scope even after the outer function has finished executing.</li>
            <li>Private functions can be created using closures, enabling encapsulation and protecting internal logic.</li>
        </ul>
