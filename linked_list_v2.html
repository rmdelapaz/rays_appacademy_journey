        <h2>Introduction to Linked Lists</h2>
        <p>Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science. Unlike arrays, linked lists consist of nodes that are connected via pointers. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.</p>
        
        <h3>Analogy: The Train Cars</h3>
        <p>Imagine a linked list as a train where each train car is connected to the next one. Each car (node) holds some cargo (data) and has a connector (reference) to the next car. If you know where the first car is, you can traverse through the train by moving from one car to the next via the connectors.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Use Linked Lists?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Size:</strong> Linked lists can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Insertions/Deletions:</strong> Adding or removing elements is more efficient compared to arrays, especially for large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Utilization:</strong> They don't require a contiguous block of memory, which can be beneficial in memory-constrained environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating a Linked List in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript doesn't have a built-in linked list type, but you can create one using objects and classes.</p>
        
        <h3>Defining a Node</h3>
        <pre>
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Each <code>Node</code> instance holds some <code>data</code> and a <code>next</code> pointer that references the next node in the list.</p>
        
        <h3>Creating the Linked List Class</h3>
        <pre>
class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
    
    // Methods will be added here
}
        </pre>
        <p>The <code>LinkedList</code> class manages the nodes. The <code>head</code> property points to the first node in the list.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Basic Operations</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Inserting a Node at the End</h3>
        <p>Let's add a method to insert a new node at the end of the list.</p>
        <pre>
insert(data) {
    let newNode = new Node(data);
    if (!this.head) {
        this.head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
}
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head. Otherwise, we traverse the list to find the last node and set its <code>next</code> pointer to the new node.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Traversing the List</h3>
        <p>To view all the elements in the list, we can traverse it:</p>
        <pre>
printList() {
    let current = this.head;
    while (current) {
        console.log(current.data);
        current = current.next;
    }
}
        </pre>
        
        <h3>3. Deleting a Node</h3>
        <p>Deleting a node involves changing the <code>next</code> pointer of the previous node to skip over the node to be deleted.</p>
        <pre>
delete(data) {
    if (!this.head) return;
    if (this.head.data === data) {
        this.head = this.head.next;
        return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next && current.next.data !== data) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (current.next) {
        current.next = current.next.next;
    }
}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>
        
        <h3>Metaphor: Treasure Hunt</h3>
        <p>Think of traversing a linked list like following a treasure map where each clue (node) leads you to the next clue. You can't skip ahead without following the clues in order.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Inserting at a Specific Position</h3>
        <pre>
insertAt(data, index) {
    if (index < 0) return;
    let newNode = new Node(data);
    if (index === 0) {
        newNode.next = this.head;
        this.head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    let previous;
    let count = 0;
    while (count < index && current) {
        previous = current;
        current = current.next;
        count++;
    }
    newNode.next = current;
    previous.next = newNode;
}
        </pre>
        
        <h3>2. Reversing a Linked List</h3>
        <p>Reversing a linked list changes the direction of the pointers so that the last node becomes the head.</p>
        <pre>
reverse() {
    let previous = null;
    let current = this.head;
    let nextNode;
    while (current) {
        nextNode = current.next;
        current.next = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = nextNode;
    }
    this.head = previous;
}
        </pre>

        <h2>Practical Real-World Examples</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Browser History Navigation</h3>
        <p>Web browsers use a form of linked lists to manage your navigation history. Each page you visit is a node, and you can move back and forth through your history by traversing these nodes.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Music Playlists</h3>
        <p>Music apps often use linked lists to manage playlists. Each song is a node, and the app can easily move to the next or previous song.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Image Viewers</h3>
        <p>Image viewing software can use linked lists to move through a collection of images, allowing users to go to the next or previous image smoothly.</p>

        <h2>When and Why to Use Linked Lists</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficient Insertions/Deletions:</strong> When you need to frequently add or remove items from the beginning or middle of a collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Unknown List Size:</strong> When the number of elements isn't known in advance and can change dynamically.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> When memory allocation needs to be dynamic and efficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, linked lists have slower access times compared to arrays because you can't directly access an element by index; you have to traverse the list from the head.</p>

        <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Implement a method to find the middle element of a linked list.</li>
            <li>Write a function to detect if there's a cycle in a linked list.</li>
            <li>Implement a doubly linked list where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.</li>
            <li>Create a method to remove duplicate values from a linked list.</li>
        </ol>
