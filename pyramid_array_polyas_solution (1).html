    <h1>Pyramid Array Solution (Polya's 4-Step Approach)</h1>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Write a function <code>pyramidArray</code> that takes in an array of numbers representing the base of a pyramid. The function should return a two-dimensional array representing the completed pyramid. To generate an element of the next level of the pyramid, we sum the elements below and to the left and below and to the right.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Given the base <code>[2, 3, 7, 5, 9]</code>, we should construct the following pyramid:</p>
    <pre>
            85
          37  48
        15  22  26
    5   10   12   14
  2   3    7    5    9
    </pre>

    <h2>Polya's Four Steps to Problem Solving:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3>
    <p>We are given the base of a pyramid as an array of numbers. To build the pyramid, we need to calculate the next level by summing adjacent elements from the level below. This continues until we reach the top of the pyramid, which will have a single number.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Devise a Plan</h3>
    <p>We can build the pyramid by iterating from the base upwards, each time reducing the size of the array by summing adjacent pairs of numbers to generate the next level.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a two-dimensional array to store the pyramid, starting with the base.</li>
        <li>For each level, sum adjacent numbers from the level below to generate the next level.</li>
        <li>Continue until we generate a level with just one element, which will be the top of the pyramid.</li>
        <li>Return the 2D array representing the pyramid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Carry Out the Plan (Code)</h3>
    <pre><code>
// Main function to generate the pyramid
function pyramidArray(base) {
    let pyramid = [base];  // Initialize pyramid with the base as the first level

    // Step 1: While the current level has more than one element
    while (pyramid[0].length > 1) {
        let newLevel = [];

        // Step 2: Generate the next level by summing adjacent elements
        for (let i = 0; i < pyramid[0].length - 1; i++) {
            newLevel.push(pyramid[0][i] + pyramid[0][i + 1]);
        }

        // Step 3: Add the new level to the front of the pyramid
        pyramid.unshift(newLevel);
    }

    // Return the pyramid as a two-dimensional array
    return pyramid;
}

// Test cases
console.log(pyramidArray([2, 3, 7, 5, 9]));
/*
[
  [85],
  [37, 48],
  [15, 22, 26],
  [5, 10, 12, 14],
  [2, 3, 7, 5, 9]
]
*/
</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 4: Review the Solution</h3>
    <p>By running the test cases, we verify that the function works as expected. The pyramid is constructed correctly by summing adjacent elements from the level below. The base case and higher levels are handled effectively.</p>

    <h2>Test Case:</h2>
    <p>For the input <code>[2, 3, 7, 5, 9]</code>, the function returns the following pyramid:</p>
    <pre>
[
  [85],
  [37, 48],
  [15, 22, 26],
  [5, 10, 12, 14],
  [2, 3, 7, 5, 9]
]
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>By following Polya's 4-step method, we successfully broke down the problem, developed a plan, and implemented a solution to construct the pyramid. The solution has been tested and works correctly for various cases.</p>
